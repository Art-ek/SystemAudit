# SystemAudit is a simple system inventory script for Windows OS only

 SystemAudit will show you how cool is a task automation using OOP in Powershell.
 What is it for?
 You can gather some information about your local or even remote systems and create a trivial html report.
 Also with few small modifications you could customise nearly everything and add more details to the output.

    IMPORTANT !! YOU'D NEED AT LEAST POWERSHELL 5.x as I decided to use classes !! goodies added to ver 5.
